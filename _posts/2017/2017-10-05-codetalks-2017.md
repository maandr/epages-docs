## An introduction to Kotlin by example

During the second day of this years codetalks [Dmitry Kandalov](https://twitter.com/dmitrykandalov?lang=en) gave a very practical introduction to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) own programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which just recently was [announced as an official Android language](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/). 
With basic live-coding examples, he demonstrated how simple Kotlin can be integrated within existing JVM based projects and how easy it is to use libraries from the Java ecosystem in Kotlin which rapidly speeds up development.

_"Kotlin is what Java 9 should have been if it as written today from scratch."_ - This quote from the talk description pretty much summarized the tone of Kandalov's talk. It was an entertaining quick tour to get to know Kotlin that made me look forward to getting hands-on Kotlin and maybe introduce it to our JVM-based microservice architecture some day.

## Die Monde und Du (The Monad and You)

Who always pondered how an application that runs over animals on the texanian highway could be ideally structured will be able to find answers to that question in [Michael Sperber](https://twitter.com/sperbsen)'s talks. In his contribution to the codetalks 2016 _["Developing more efficiently with Functional Programming"](https://developer.epages.com/blog/2016/10/07/code-talks-2016-retrospective.html)_ Sperber already talked about functional programming and how useful its main principles are.

This year he focused his talk _"Die Monade und Du (The Monad and You)"_ around the abstract construct of monads. Showcasing entertaining examples in Haskell he explained what exactly a monad is and how it naturally emerges in software when applying functional programming principles.
