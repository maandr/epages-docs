## An introduction to Kotlin by example

During the second day of this years codetalks [Dmitry Kandalov](https://twitter.com/dmitrykandalov?lang=en) gave a very practical introduction to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) own programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which just recently was [announced as an offical Android language](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/). 
With basic live-coding examples he demonstated how simple Kotlin can be integrated within existing JVM based projects and how easy it makes it to use libraries from the java ecosystem which rapidly speeds up development.

_"Kotlin is what Java 9 should have been if it as written today from scratch."_ - This quote from the talk description pretty much summerized the tone of Kandalov's talk. It was a entertaining quick tour to get to know Kotlin that made me look forward to get hands on Kotlin and maybe introduce it within our JVM-based microservice architecture some day.
