## An introduction to Kotlin by example

During the second day of this years codetalks [Dmitry Kandalov](https://twitter.com/dmitrykandalov?lang=en) gave a very practical introduction to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) own programming language [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), which just recently was [announced as an official Android language](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/). 
With basic live-coding examples, he demonstrated how simple Kotlin can be integrated within existing JVM based projects and how easy it is to use libraries from the Java ecosystem in Kotlin which rapidly speeds up development.

_"Kotlin is what Java 9 should have been if it as written today from scratch."_ - This quote from the talk description pretty much summarized the tone of Kandalov's talk. It was an entertaining quick tour to get to know Kotlin that made me look forward to getting hands-on Kotlin and maybe introduce it to our JVM-based microservice architecture some day.

## Die Monde und Du (The Monad and You)

Who always pondered how an application that runs over animals on the texanian highway could be ideally structured will be able to find answers to that question in [Michael Sperber](https://twitter.com/sperbsen)'s talks. In his contribution to the codetalks 2016 _["Developing more efficiently with Functional Programming"](https://developer.epages.com/blog/2016/10/07/code-talks-2016-retrospective.html)_ Sperber already talked about functional programming and how useful its main principles are.

This year he focused his talk _"Die Monade und Du (The Monad and You)"_ around the abstract construct of monads. Showcasing entertaining examples in Haskell he explained what exactly a monad is and how it naturally emerges in software when applying functional programming principles.

## Building a scalable CSS-only slideshow in 1024 Bytes

Down in the past memory was a precious good. Nowadays it's cheap. This circumstance must have inspired [Matthias Reuter](https://twitter.com/gweax) when submitting his talk, or let's rather call it code challenge, _Building a scalable CSS-only slideshow in 1024 Bytes_ for codetalks 2017.

In his presentation, he explained how he build a CSS driven slideshow, with only bare minimum use of javascript which he afterward manually morphed into the most minified version possible. Minification measures he took included dropping whitespaces, optional colons, making use of language defaults and interpretations, the smart grouping of CSS-styles and even optimising calculation algorithms to shorten the required lines of code.

The result wasn't exactly an example page from the clean code book, but it was an entertaining demonstration of what is possible to achieve when you know your language in and out and focus on a specific goal. The talk ended with an [open GitHub challange](https://github.com/gweax/code-talks-challenge) to everyone how feels challenged to do better or in this case smaller than Reuter. And of course, the tool used for the presentation was the same CSS slideshow the presentation was about - How meta is that?
